# Technical support interview challenge

***
Greetings, you're working with two containers: the server and the agent.
The agent is programmed to automatically establish a connection with the server, but there seems to be a problem. Your task is to resolve these issues and initiate docker-compose. Your goal is to view the agent's logs, specifically looking for the message: "Successfully connected".

***

For building locally use:
```
docker-compose build
```

For running this compose use:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

For cleaning:
```
docker-compose down
```

Good luck!!!
