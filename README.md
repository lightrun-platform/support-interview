Hi, you got 2 containers, server and agent.
Agent automatically is trying to connect to the server, but something went wrong.
Fix all issues and start docker-compose, your purpose to see logs of agent where it prints: "Successfully connected"

For building locally use:
```
docker-compose build
```

For running this compose use:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

For cleaning:
```
docker-compose down
```

Good luck!!!
